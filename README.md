# WTWR (What to Wear?)
## this is the 'server' side called SE_Project_Express - Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. 

You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. 

The eventual goal is to create a server with an RESTful API and user authorization.

This project helps users manage their wardrobe items and determine what to wear based on the weather. 

## Prior to Submitting
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. 
The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

## Project Functionality

- Users can:
  - View a collection of clothing items.
  - Add a new item (with name, image URL, and weather suitability).
  - Like or dislike items.
  - Delete items they own.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Node.js** & **Express.js** – backend server and routing
- **MongoDB** & **Mongoose** – database and object modeling
- **ESLint** – code linting using Airbnb + Prettier config
- **REST API** – standardized API structure
- **Middleware** – for centralized error handling and mock authorization
- **Environment-based configuration** – using `process.env`

# Sprint 12
## Project 12 - Introduction to Back-End: Node.js and Express.js:

### Overview:

- Intro
- Features
- Links

### Intro:

- The back-end portion of this project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application.

- With it I gained a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deployed web applications on a remote machine.

- The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization, for which this project served as a first step.

- This project can be run with these prompts:

- - `npm run start` — to launch the server

- - `npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Features:

- Server-Side Development
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Postman
- REST API
- Databases
- MongoDB
- SQL

# Sprint 13
## Project 13 - Back-End Authentication and Authorization:

### Overview:

- Intro
- Features
- Links

### Intro:

This phase of the WTWR project focuses on implementing user authentication and authorization features. The key additions include:

- User registration and login functionality with secure password handling
- JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
- Protected routes that require user authentication
- User authorization to ensure users can only modify their own data
- Enhanced error handling and input validation using regular expressions

This implementation ensures secure user management while maintaining the RESTful architecture established in the previous sprint.

- This project can be run with these prompts:

- - `npm run start` — to launch the server

- - `npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Features:

- Server-Side Authentication and Authorization
- Authentication Methods
- Authorization Methods
- JS Web Tokens
- JS Regular Expressions (Regexs)

### Links:

- Link to the project on GH Pages: [(...)]
- postman - Your public URL will be: https://www.postman.com/jjplamoottil
